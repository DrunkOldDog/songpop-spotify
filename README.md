I guess most of us are familiar with [Songpop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SongPop). It was a cool game from our childhood that got pretty competitive sometimes. So this project is all about bringing this game back to life but by using the awesome [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

Unfortunately, this API is not too kind with _Games/Trivias_, so that's why you will need your own keys to make it work with your account. However, I will do my best to help you ease this steps!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses Spotify API and Redis on the background. So you will need some _API KEYS_ to make it work.

Here are some docs so you can get your own:

- [Getting started with Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- [Create a Redis Cloud Database](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/databases/create-database/)

### Installation

This project is based on `npm`. But feel free to use whichever tool you want.

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the application, you will need to add an `.env.local` file at the root of the project. This file would need the following values:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>

REDIS_PASSWORD=<YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD>
REDIS_HOST=<YOUR_REDIS_HOST>
REDIS_PORT=<YOUR_REDIS_PORT>

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<SOMETHING_FUNNY_COMES_HERE>
```

Finally, start the development environment.

```bash
npm run dev
```

With this, you'll be damn ready to run the app locally. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Roadmap

Features needed to achieve this main application scope.

- [x] Add Games Connected with Spotify API
